          Hello, my name is Andy Felix. I am a Computer Science student at
          College of the Desert from Palm Desert, California. I love to program
          anything, but specialize in creating websites. My coding journey begun
          during my senior year of high school for my AP Computer Science Class.
          From then, I decided to major in Computer Science where I learned C++.
          It felt like I wasn't learning enough so I decided to start learning
          on my own. Full Stack Devlopment intruiged me so I decided to start on
          focuing on the front-end first. I started by learning JavaScript followed by html and
          css. Then started creating websites using frameworks such as React,
          Tailwind, and NextJs. Currently I am looking for an internship to
          improve and get hands on work epxierence, but until that time I am
          working on projects contiuining enchancing my skills.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-8">
          While I'm not creating websites, I love to go to the gym, play basketball, or
          anything that involves the outside.
